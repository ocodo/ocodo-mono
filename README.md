**OcodoMono** is best suited for users who have a penchant for extreme dark mode aesthetics and value the minimalist elegance of an ultra-thin monospaced font.

Delicacy meets practical functionality. It shines when used in coding environments, text editors, terminal applications, and UI elements in designs that embrace a stark contrast between elements.

Serif reduction is the maxim.

> **Note:** On Firefox running Linux, font hinting is imperfect at smaller sizes, which can lead to noticeably reduced clarity.
